# Welcome to Amrita Systems Reading Group!
This study group is about the internals of compilers, programming languages, distributed systems, databases, file formats, internet protocols, operating systems, browsers, emulators, and other cool stuff + provides a community around this kind of exploration. You're not expected to have attended previous weeks and expected to adhere to the standards of the Geneva War Convention (optional).

 ```
### * Scheduled Events

#### [x] BSOD ( biweekly sessions of development ) :
BSOD is a one-week jam where you implement a cool piece of software from scratch. Why build things from scratch? Because that's the only way real progress is made. Every impactful project started life as a small experiment. Plus, writing something from scratch turns theory into practice. You may think you know how a piece of technology works, but until you write it yourself, you truly wouldn't understand it completely.

#### [x] OCaml My Caml :
It's a week-long hacking retreat to work on a variety of OCaml projects, including but not limited to the compiler, concurrency libraries, platform tooling, and benchmarking. Dive into functional programming and learn to appreciate actual ML languages instead of drooling over whitepaper like Haskell ( We will soon be picking apart GHC btw).

#### [x] Open Session :
Free-for-all kind of event where people give talks, get help on their homework/projects, and work on random stuff. This is open to all and is an excellent way to figure out if this group is right for you. If you do not have an idea, a curated one will be provided to you. You can even just sit and watch what each member is doing without necessarily needing to pair-program (I learned so much more from reading others' code and working with others so I wish to recreate this).

# Ground Rules & General Information
The only requirements you need to join the study group are pure consistency and willingness to work and have fun. This is an all-inclusive community where there are little to no barriers (aside from the ground rules). Do visit the website to learn about our underlying philosophy and please refer to the [Left-Pad incident](https://www.davidhaney.io/npm-left-pad-have-we-forgotten-how-to-program/) on why harshly emphasize working on complex projects. This group is not for you if you only wanna do the bare minimum and stay in your comfort zone.

### 0. Unspoken Rule of ASRG
You do not talk about ASRG. This might as well be an illegal gambling den and I might get expelled from Amrita for doing something cool. But please do share this with anyone who might be interested and save a life.

### 1. No Normie Projects
This group is meant to explore the depths of CS and is meant to be **HARD**. My philosophy is essentially:


> The more you train in battle, the less you bleed in war.


If you wish to work in Big Tech companies handling large-scale issues, it's paramount that you know your fundamentals and there is no substitute for actual experience.

As a rule of thumb, if your project idea can be found on a majority of other's resumes - It is not a good idea. Come up with your own idea and have some originality ffs - if you lack creativity, exhaust the group's resources cause there is always something for everyone here (take a look at the headline in the website).

### 2. No VSCODE
Kind of a nitpick but please learn to use NeoVim or Vim or Emacs or Spacemacs or Helix or any other thing. Avoid Bloated IDEs and learn your goddamn environment, It is embarrassing to see CS majors not knowing how to debug errors and getting comfortable because everything is set up for them. As Feynman says, If you know something - you can implement it from scratch and explain it to 5-year-olds.

> [!NOTE]
> Rule 2 exists to encourage people to improve their productivity and expand their boundaries. You are still allowed to join the study group and work with VS Code. I wanna add in the No Mouse rule too in order to encourage productivity but I suck ass with it myself so imma let it be and make rules as we go by lol. Please read the website and decide for yourself like an adult if the group's philosophy is for you or not. You are more than welcome to steal our ideas for yourself without necessarily participating. Any of our members would be more than happy to help, please remember not to be a jerk. These " Ground Rules " are not set in stone and just act as a deterrent to weed out people, that's all.

# Feature List
    - Link Wiki to the official website
    - Update topics + links on the website after every session 

# Contribution Guide:

## Project Ideas
1. Check if your project ideas satisfy the requirements specified in the ground rules.
2. If so, check the existing project ideas to see if your idea integrates nicely with one
of them, or if it is a separate project on its own.
3. Is your project completed? then you probably want to showcase it in a session.
4. If not, is it a reading/exploration project? Then it probably doesn't require a GitHub repo,
contact the lead <link to username> or hit us up in the WhatsApp group.
5. If it is a group project to work on, make sure it fits nicely within 2 hrs. 
It probably requires a GitHub repo, contact the lead anyway <link to username> or hit us up in the WhatsApp group.
6. Once a date is confirmed for your project, find reference material to get started on it, and share this with
everyone else.
7. Present/read/develop the project, and have fun!

## Contributing to Existing Projects
1. Refer to each project for any possible GitHub issues.
2. Feel free to reach out to the primary developer of the project from the README file.
3. Follow any code guidelines specified in the README (chances of there being any guidelines whatsoever are pretty slim).
4. If it's a large contribution with significant complexity, consider bringing it up as an idea for an open session or BSOD.
