# Welcome to Amrita Systems Reading Group!
This study group is about internals of compilers, programming languages, distributed systems, databases, file formats, internet protocols, operating systems, browsers, emulators, and other cool stuff + provide a community around this kind of exploration. You're not expected to have attended previous weeks and expected adhere to the standards of the Geneva War Convention (optional).

### >> Scheduled Events

#### x BSOD ( biweekly sessions of development ):
BSOD is a a one-week jam where you implement a cool peice of software from scratch.  Why build things from scratch? Because that's the only way real progress is made. Every impactful project started life as a small experiment. Plus, writing something from scratch turns theory into practice. You may think you know how a piece of technology works, but until you write it yourself, it won't really stick. There's no substitute for direct experience.

#### x OCamlMyCaml:
it's a week-long hacking retreat to work on a variety of OCaml projects, including but not limited to the compiler, concurrency libraries, platform tooling, and benchmarking. Dive into functional programming and learn to appricate actual ML languages instead of drooling over whitepaper like Hashell (We will soon be picking apart GHC btw).

#### x Open Session:
Free for all event where people give talks, get help on their homework / projects, work on random stuff. This is open to all and is an excellent way to figure out if this group is right for you. If you do not have an idea, a curated one will be provided to you. You can even just sit and watch what each members are doing without necessarily needing to pair-program (I learnt so much more from reading others code and working with others so wish to instill this)

# Ground Rules & General Information
The only requirements you need to join the study group is pure consistency and willingness to have work and have fun. This is an all inclusive community where there is little to no barriers (aside from the ground rules). Do visit the website to learn about our underlying Philosophy and please refer the [LeftPad incident](https://www.davidhaney.io/npm-left-pad-have-we-forgotten-how-to-program/) on why harshly emphasise working on complex projects. This group is not for you if you only wanna do the bare minimum and stay in your comfort zone.

### 0. 0th Rule of ASRG
You do not talk about ASRG. This might as well be an illegal gambling den and I might get expelled from Amrita for bringing in competency

### 1. No Normie Projects
This group is meant to explore the depths of CS and CS is **HARD**. My philosophy is essentially 
> The more you train in battle, the less you bleed in war

If you wish to work in Big Tech companies handling large scale issues, it's paramount you know your fundamentals and there really is no substitute to actual experience.

As a rule of thumb, if your project idea can be found on a majority of other's resume - It is not a good idea // come up with your own idea and have some originality ffs - if you lack creativity, exhaust the group's resources cause you really can't go wrong (take a look at the headline in the website)

### 2. No VSCODE
Kind of a nitpick but please learn to use NeoVim or Vim or Emacs or Spacemacs or Helix or any other thing. Avoid Bloated IDEs and learn your goddamn environment, It is embarrassing to see CS majors not knowing how to debug errors and having everything setup for them. Like Feynman says, If you know something - you can implement it from scratch and explain it to 5 year olds.

> [!NOTE]
> I wanna add in the No Mouse rule too in order to encourage productivity but I suck ass with it myself so imma let it be and make rules as we go by lol. Please do read the website and decide for yourself like an adult if the group's philosophy is for you or not. You are more than welcome to steal our ideas for yourself without necessarily participating. Any of our members would be more than happy to help, just don't be a jerk.

# Feature List
     - Link Wiki to official website
     - Update topics + links in the website after every session 

# Contribution Guide:

## Project Ideas
1. Check if your project ideas satisfy the requirements specified in ground rules.
2. If so, check the existing project ideas to see if your idea integrates nicely with one
of them, or if it is a separate project on its own
3. Is your project completed? then you probably want to showcase it in a session
4. If not, is it a reading/exploration project? Then it probably doesn't require a GitHub repo,
contact the lead <link to username> or hit us up in the WhatsApp group.
5. If it is a group project to work on, make sure it fits nicely within 2 hrs. 
It probably requires a GitHub repo, contact the lead anyway <link to username> or hit us up at in the WhatsApp group.
6. Once a date is confirmed for your project, find reference material to get started on it, and share this with
everyone else
7. Present/read/develop the project, and have fun!

## Contributing to Existing Projects In the Repo
1. Refer each project for any possible GitHub issues
2. Feel free to reach out to the primary developer of the project from the README file
3. Follow any code guidelines specified in the README (chances of there being any guidelines
whatsoever is pretty slim)
4. If it's a large contribution with significant complexity, consider bringing 
it up as an idea for an open session or BSOD
